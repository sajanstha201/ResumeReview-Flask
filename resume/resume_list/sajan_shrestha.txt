  The website developed employs Django and React for predicting Bitcoin prices with LSTM Neural Network models. It integrates Yahoo Finance for data, deploys on Heroku, and boasts a robust React UI. Secure authentication is ensured through Django, utilizing SQL databases. The LSTM models provide accurate Bitcoin predictions, while automated scraping from Yahoo Finance ensures up-to-date data. This project showcases expertise in full-stack development,
 machine learning, and financial analysis.
   A Python machine learning project was developed to predict survival outcomes for Titanic passengers. It encompasses data pre-processing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation. Five machine learning algorithms were explored, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines (SVM), and Naive Bayes. Their performance was optimized through cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning. This project demonstrates expertise in data science, machine learning,
 and predictive modelling techniques.
   Developed a responsive website using React.js for RAHAT Mental Health Club. Gathered requirements, received feedback, and iterated on design/functionality. Includes mental health
 resources and counsellor details, ensuring usability across devices
    and implemented user-friendly inference interface on Google Colab.
